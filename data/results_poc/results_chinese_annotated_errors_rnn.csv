In the note it also says that the show starts at 19:30, and so I went in at 19:25. The show started at 20:15, which means it wasted one hour of my time. The note says that are discounts available there are discounts available on tickets , but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is no discount on the tickets. When the show had finished . , I decided to go and visit your theatre restaurant , . But I went there and it was closed for some reason. I was really hungry and I went to another restaurant as soon as I | can. The note says that your perfect evening out, I thought I could get my money back, with your poor service and all my reasons, but it was not ask for money back .
