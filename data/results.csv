TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet , none of these things existed seventy years ago. I think that the life we live is easier than the life our parents lived, thanks to technology. We can do things our grandparents could only dream of.  |  Internet, I think, is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity. My life has not been affected or changed by technology, because when I was born, most of the things that I use in my daily life already existed. But technology is becoming more and more complicated, and new things are invented every day, so I think that our lives will be completely different in forty years. And, since all these new things only make our lives easier, technology is welcome. "
